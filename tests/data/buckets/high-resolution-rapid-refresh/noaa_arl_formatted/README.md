Test meteorological data was generated from two CONUS HRRR reanalysis.

The files were cropped to the following extent to reduce their size for tests:

| `xtrct_grid` arg | value  |
| ---------------- | ------ |
| `xmin`           | -112.9 |
| `xmax`           | -111.1 |
| `ymin`           | 40.1   |
| `ymax`           | 41.4   |
| `n_levels`       | 20     |

This gives a grid of 59 longitudes, 41 latitudes, and 20 vertical levels.
